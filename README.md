# Majoreni Tree Planting Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes tree planting activities in Majoreni, focusing on the total number of trees planted, area planted (in hectares), species distribution, and planting trends over time. The analysis is based on real-world data collected from reforestation efforts.

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Total Trees Planted:** Over **978,000** trees planted between 2024 and 2025.
- **Total Area Planted:** Approximately **51 hectares** (converted from square meters).
- **Species Distribution:**
  - *Avicenia Marina*: 6,600 trees planted.
  - *Ceriops Tagal*: 971,528 trees planted.
- **Monthly Trends:**
  - Peak planting months: January and February.
  - Slower planting activity in October and November.
- **Efficiency:** On average, **22,230 trees were planted per day**.
